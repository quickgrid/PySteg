A python tool writen in `wxpython` for steganography to `store zip or other files into one or more image files` with ability encrypt the hidden data. It needs to run from python enviroment as there is no released app. 

Easy way to get it running is to get anaconda then create a conda enviorment with `requirements.txt`. It any package is missing it needs to be `pip` or `conda` installed.
